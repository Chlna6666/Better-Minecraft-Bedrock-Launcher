### 1. Agreement Notice & Effectiveness
Welcome to Better Minecraft Bedrock Launcher (the "Software"). Please read and fully understand this agreement (the "Agreement") before using the Software, especially clauses regarding **disclaimers, limitation of liability, user undertakings, and dispute resolution**.

By installing, launching, signing in, or otherwise using the Software, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted all terms of this Agreement, which becomes legally binding between you and the developer(s) of the Software.

### 2. Definitions
* **Developer(s)**: The maintainers/contributors of the Software and any entity distributing the Software (if any).
* **User / You**: Any individual or organization that installs or uses the Software.
* **Game**: Minecraft Bedrock Edition (including preview/beta and education editions) and related services.
* **Lobby / Multiplayer Feature**: Any matchmaking, lobby, room, or multiplayer-related feature provided by the Software.

### 3. Eligibility & Account Security
* **Authorized Access**: The Software is an unofficial launcher. You must ensure you have lawful authorization to use the Game and comply with Mojang/Microsoft policies (including EULA and community guidelines).
* **Accounts & Credentials**: You are responsible for safeguarding your accounts and credentials. Any account bans, restrictions, or losses caused by your actions or omissions are borne solely by you.

### 4. Privacy & Data Security
* **Basic Runtime Telemetry**: To improve the Software, we may collect and upload basic runtime information (this does not include accounts or in-game data). Such information is typically used for diagnostics, performance analysis, and product improvement.
* **Encrypted Locally Before Upload**: Relevant information will be encrypted locally before it is uploaded.
* **Opt-out**: You can disable this in `Settings -> Launcher`. Disabling does not affect core functionality, but it may reduce troubleshooting effectiveness.
* **Local Storage**: Configuration, mods, and game files are generally stored locally on your device. You are responsible for backups.
* **Network Requests**: The Software may make necessary network requests for update checks, downloads, or multiplayer-related services.

### 5. Acceptable Use & Prohibited Conduct
To protect users and the Developer(s), you must not use the Software to:
* distribute pirated content, bypass authorization, or circumvent security mechanisms;
* develop, distribute, or use cheats/hacks, or otherwise undermine fair play;
* distribute illegal content or engage in conduct that violates applicable laws and regulations;
* infringe others' lawful rights (including intellectual property, privacy, or reputation rights).

### 6. Online Multiplayer Terms (Lobby Feature)
* **Technology & Safety Mechanisms**: The lobby feature uses a modified version of EasyTier and applies application-level mechanisms (such as ACL rules) to help improve user safety.
* **Legal Compliance (Mainland China)**: If you are located in, or your usage scenario involves, Mainland China, you undertake to strictly comply with applicable laws and regulations of Mainland China and not to use the lobby feature for any illegal or non-compliant purposes.
* **Assumption of Risk Undertaking**: You undertake that all risks arising from using the lobby feature are borne solely by you, including but not limited to network fluctuations, connection failures, latency, disconnects, packet loss, and third-party environment differences.
* **Legal Compliance (Your Region)**: You undertake to comply with all laws and regulations of your country and region throughout the entire multiplayer process.
* **P2P Networking Notice**: The lobby feature uses P2P technology. After a successful connection, users in the same room connect directly with each other. In principle, no third-party server is used to relay your traffic. Multiplayer quality depends heavily on participants' network conditions and NAT/firewall policies.

### 9. Changes & Termination

* **Dispute Resolution**: Disputes shall be resolved through friendly consultation first; failing that, either party may bring an action before a competent court at the defendant's domicile.
